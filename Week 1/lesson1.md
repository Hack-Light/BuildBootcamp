NodeJs was developed by Ryan Dahl in 2009. It is a server side platform built on Google’s Chrome JavaScript Engine

It is an open source cross platform runtime environment, mean it can run on any OS like Windows, OSX,linux and more.

According to its official documentation

> Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

It is use to develop chat applications, video streaming sites, I/O intensive web applications, etc.

It is completely free and is open sourced meaning you can see, clone and even copy the source code.

## **Features of Node.js**

- Fast - Node.js is very fast being built on Google Chromes V8 JavaScript engine.

- Single Threaded - Applications built on top of Node.js use a single threaded event loop mode architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients which makes it possible to reduce memory usage.

- Asynchronous and event driven - Code written with node.js do not wait for call /api to return before they start executing codes, this means they are non blocking codes which makes them faster.  Rather wait for results they they treat each request as an event and move on to execute other codes and when the event returns a result a bunch of code is executed.
